# Brad's Dotfiles

I use [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup) to keep my application settings and config files synced via Dropbox. On a fresh install, Mackup will automatically restore all settings with one command. It's awesome.

To avoid committing sensitive information, `.gitignore` is set to opt-in files and preferences instead of opt-out.

# Key Bindings

I use Caps Lock as a psuedo hyper key - it is mapped to combine ⌘⌃⌥⇧ which creates new conflict-free modifier. I use ⌘⌃⌥⇧ + _n_ for everything. This idea came from [Steve Losh](https://twitter.com/stevelosh)'s blog post titled [A Modern Space Cadet](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/a-modern-space-cadet/).
